## 3D Print
I used pet-g filament for printing and PrusaSlicer 2.5. I believe that it is necessary to use 3D glue to increase the adhesion of the printed table. I tried to make the keyboard as small as possible. Perhaps another filament will not be able to give the desired stiffness. It took me a while to print the arch and the bottom beautifully. Several models ended up in the trash can. I will attach a screenshot of the location of difficult to print models.
